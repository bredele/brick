# maple

  > work in progress

  webapp toolset

## Installation

  Install with [component](http://component.io):

    $ component install leafs/maple

  For the first release, maple will work as a standalone library or through other package managers such as browserify or bower.


## Concept

Maple.js is a set of Commonjs components to create maintainable and configurable web applications.

### View and Bindings


Views in Maple.js are reusable components that help you to create a DOM element from a template:

```js
var view = require('maple/view');

view()
  .html('<div id="myElement"></div>')
  .insert(document.body);
```

> A template can be a string, a DOM element or a custom function.

A view is the behavior behind this DOM element. It updates itself when the model changes, registers sophisticated bindings and control the element life cycle:

```js
view()
  .html('<div plugin>{label}</div>', {
    label: 'maple'
  })
  .plug('plugin', function(node) {
    //do something on node
  })
  .insert(document.body);
```

Plugins (method `plug`) in Maple.js are attributes that link a DOM node with a piece of JavaScript logic in a MVVM fashion. There is already plugins to handler user events, hide or show elements, repeat elements once per item into a store, etc. What's great is that you can reuse these plugins or create your own.

### Store and Emitter

Store is your model layer. It's basically a wrapper for your models and collections that contains your data and all the logic surrounding it such as formatters, access control, computed properties, reset, local storage and can be easily extended with its middleware engine.

```js
var Store = require('store');

var store = new Store({
	label: 'maple'
});
store.get('maple');
store.on('change maple', function() {
	//do something
});
store.set('label', 'leafs');
```

> Store is based on an emitter (available under `maple/emitter`). 

Store works with both object (model) and arrays (collection) and reduce the overhead to have separate components for both of them. It's just dead simple!

```js
var store = new Store([{
	name: 'olivier'
}, {
	name: 'bredele'
}]);

store.reset([{
	name: 'maple'
}]);
```

### Architecture

Maple.js provides an express-like api that allows to split a large web application into smaller pieces (called apps).

```js
var maple = require('maple');
var app = maple();

app.use(/* other app or middleware */);
```

An app is entirely configurable (based on a Store) and can only speak to itself. Maple provides an event bus between all the apps to keep a clean separation of responsabilities. You can add, remove or break an app without breaking your larger web application!
