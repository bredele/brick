# Brick

Brick reduces boilerplate by implementing amongst others, reactive one way binding.

```js
brick('<div>Hello ${ name }</div>', {
  name: 'olivier'
}).to(document.body);
```
see [live example]()

Brick doesn't stop there though. Despite its small size (2kb) it has a fair bit of power under the hood and a ridiculously small learning curve. 

## Learn BRICK in 5 minutes

<!-- ## Brick is your living data -->

### brick is a datastore

A brick is a datastore, a bloat-free layer to manipulate your data.

```js
var user = brick();
user.set('name','olivier');
user.set('age', 26);
user.get('name'); // => olivier
user.compute('birthday', function() {
  return this.name + 'is ' + this.age;
});
```
see [datastore](http://github.com/bredele/datastore) for full API.

### brick is an emitter

A brick is an observable. it allows you to publish/subscribe events and also to get notified when there has been a change of data or in its [state](#brick-is-a-state-machine).

```js
user.on('change birthday', function(val) { 
  // => olivier is 27
});
user.set('age', 27);
```

This notifications allows the brick to produce updated output and HTML.

see [emitter](http://github.com/component/emitter) for full API.

<!-- ## Brick is your living dom -->

### brick is reactive 

Brick intelligently updates your HTML whenever the underlying data changes.

```js
var user = brick('<div>${name} is ${age}</div>');
user.set('name', 'olivier');
user.set('age', 27);
```

It eliminates DOM manipulation from the list of things you have to worry about. Brick will also work with SVG nodes or even server side!

<!-- 
```html
<div class="twitter ${theme}">
	<p>${text}</p>
	<span>${ text.length } character${text.length > 0 ? 's' : ''}</span>
</div>
```
 -->
### brick is declarative

You also can extend existing DOM attributes or even create new ones with plugins.

```js
var user = brick('<a href="bredele"></a>');
link.attr('href', function(node, content) {
  node.href = 'http://github.com/' + content;
});
```

See [result on live]().

A plugin is as simple as a function but the possibilities are numerous. There is plugins to listen DOM events, synchronize a brick data with a database and more.


### brick is a state machine

Brick will notify you at different step of it's lifecycle.

```js
user.on('mounted', function() {
  // do something on mounted 
})
```

But that's not all! It is also a [finite state machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), allowing you to create your own states and sequence of actions. 

```js
user.hook('present', 'sick', function() {
	// transition present -> absent on sick condition
}, 'absent');

user.emit('sick');
```

### brick is composable

What if developing an application was as easy as putting pieces of Lego together? With brick you can extend or create your own tags.

```js
var user = brick('<span>${name}</span>', {
	name: 'world'
});

var welcome = brick('<h1>Hello <user></user></h1>');
welcome.tag('user', user);
```

It follows the [web component](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/) syntax with the power of a simple and concise API.


### brick is reusable

An application is also made of reusable pieces. It's a bit like assembling Lego bricks of same shapes and colors:

```js
var lego = brick('<span>${color}</span>').mold();

var yellow = user();
var green = user();
var blue = user();
```

No classes. You can create a brick and `mold` it anytime. Calling `mold` freezes a brick as well as its current state and data.
